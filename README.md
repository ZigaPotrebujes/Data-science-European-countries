# Data science starter pack

Let me start by explaining what the _real_ purpose of this analysis is. At my previous employment, I learned that one of the things you use most (as a data scientist at least) is Copy-Paste. There are a finite number of plots and infinite number of problems. Things are bound to repeat themselves, but that is a good thing! I learned that people (especially coworkers from other fields) quickly tend to lose interest if there is too many new things going on. A new color or some other feautre here and there is fine, but don't overdo it. That's why some degree of repetitiveness in this line of work is a must and I wanted to create a project where I would have different plots and its code, so I can always easily find it. Therefore, since the actual content is more of a secondary nature in this post, you may find it more interesting from a technical point of view. In this document I will stick more to my thought process, while the code itself will be stored in the workspace file. 

In short:
**Objectives**
- create a short analysis, containing few charts, which will help with copy pasting me in the future
- extract at least 1 piece of useful information (to me) in the process

I started searching for a dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). I found one that interested me about quality of life in Europe. I went straight to the source and scraped the data. 

## Cost of living
**SOURCE:** https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/rankings_by_country.jsp?title=2021

* extracted data from the source for different years
* map plot of quality of life (on first glance looks OK)

* did the same thing for 2 more metrics - healthcare and safety

* the latter triggered an alarm in my head. Sweden was far too gray for my opinion and I wanted to double check that
* first thing I did was present the data in a different way so that the actual safety score is a bit clearer

* my fears were confirmed. I **sincerely** doubt Sweden is more dangerous than Ukraine which had seen war in the recent years and hostilities still haven't really ended
* it even popped up in the top 10 most dangereous countries _worldwide_
* Upon checkin reviews I noticed other people had similar problems with Numbeo, especially with the crime scores. Although it is a hard metric to quantify, the current method they use is to survey users, which is far from reliable source of data
* I also decided to look for other sources. The first one is [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Archive:Quality_of_life_in_Europe_-_facts_and_views_-_economic_and_physical_safety&oldid=400085#Data_sources_and_availability), which is a credible source of information. It even had the data neatly prepared in charts, for our convenience.

* although the data is only for EU it is clear, that Numbeo's safety score is quite unreliable. 
* I wanted however to find another source, containing countries outside of EU as well. I found one such table on [Global Finance magazine](https://www.gfmag.com/global-data/non-economic-data/worlds-safest-countries-2019). To be fair I have never heard of it, which is not the ideal case. But since the object of observation was in itself of quite subjective nature and because they provided an adequate explanation of the factors they took into account I decided to scrape that data as well

* the data from the last 2 sources tell quite a different story, which led me to believe the healthcare data might not be that accurate either
* for the healthcare comparison I found a dataframe on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_Health_Consumer_Index)
* in order to compare the healthscores between the two sources (Numbeo and Wikipedia), I thought it'd be easier if I first normalised the data somehow 
* each country had 2 initial scores - N and W. I divided each score by the mean(respective scores of all countries) to get some idea of how the countries scores' are distributed within each scoring system
* I put the results in a scatterplot, hoping to see some correlation - as many points as possible on the diagonal (f(x) = x)
* I was pleasantly surprised to have found the data quite correlated. There were a few outliers however, which I marked on the chart

## Results
Let's now check my objectives I had at the beginning. 
* by uploading this short analysis I have primarily given myself a "copy-paste" go-to document, so this gets a check. 
[âœ“] create a short analysis, containing few charts, which will help me with copy pasting in the future

* I have learned something new, mainly:
- making map plots
- labeling only certain items on the chart
- resourcefulness in scraping data
- be wary, when using Numbeo as a source of information. Some, more common may be accurate, but some (especially those that are hard to quantify) can be completely out of whack
