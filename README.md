# Data science starter pack

Let me start by explaining what the _real_ purpose of this analysis is. At my previous employment, I learned that one of the things you use most (as a data scientist at least) is Copy-Paste. There are a finite number of plots and infinite number of problems. Things are bound to repeat themselves, but that is a good thing! I learned that people (especially coworkers from other fields) quickly tend to lose interest if there is too many new things going on. A new color or some other feautre here and there is fine, but don't overdo it. That's why some degree of repetitiveness in this line of work is a must and I wanted to create a project where I would have different plots and its code, so I can always easily find it. Therefore, since the actual content is more of a secondary nature in this post, you may find it more interesting from a technical point of view. In this document I will stick more to my thought process, while the code itself will be stored in the workspace file. 

In short:
**Objectives**
- create a short analysis, containing few charts, which will help with copy pasting me in the future
- extract at least 1 piece of useful information (to me) in the process

I started searching for a dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). I found one that interested me about quality of life in Europe. I went straight to the source and scraped the data. 

## Cost of living
**SOURCE:** https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/rankings_by_country.jsp?title=2021

* extracted data from the source for different years
* map plot of quality of life (on first glance looks OK)

* did the same thing for 2 more metrics - healthcare and safety
