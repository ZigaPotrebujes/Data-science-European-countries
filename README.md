## TOPIC: Healthcare, safety and general quality of life in Europe

Let me start by explaining what the _real_ purpose of this analysis is. At my previous employment, I learned that one of the things you use most (as a data scientist at least) is Copy-Paste. There are a finite number of plots and infinite number of problems. Things are bound to repeat themselves, but that is a good thing! I learned that people (especially coworkers from other fields) quickly tend to lose interest if there is too many new things going on. A new color or some other feautre here and there is fine, but don't overdo it. That's why some degree of repetitiveness in this line of work is a must and I wanted to create a project where I would have different plots and its code, so I can always easily find it. Therefore, since the actual content is more of a secondary nature in this post, you may find it more interesting from a technical point of view. In this document I will stick more to my thought process, while the code itself will be stored in the workspace file. 

I started searching for a dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and half of the results were COVID vaccination progress which did not really interest me. I landed on analysing some living condition indicators in European countries which will hopefully lead to me being a bit smarter or at least gain a few XP.
